# Practicing Algorithms

### Structure:
The folders are named clearly, based on the descriptions of the problems.  Each of the python files would contain on their first line, tags.  The algorithms used to solve a problem (multitude of approaches), data structures, etc.  The master list of tags will be added in this README file.

### List of Tags so far
- generator
- arrays
- moving window method

### Complexity
Descriptions, theory, and practice of complexity is contained in a separate folder.  More info to come here.
