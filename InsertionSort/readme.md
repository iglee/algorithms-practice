# Implementation
for each current value, compare with the previous list of elements.
- if compared to the previous element, the current element is bigger, switch positions
- do this til the current value is in correct place in the previous set of elements
the list is sorted when we reach the end of list

# time complexity
- worst case: n^2
- best case: n
# space complexity
- 1
